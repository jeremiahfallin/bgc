 The Club is offering more than 30 different summer camps to choose from for youth entering 2nd-12th grades this year!  The key word is FUN and we have a camp for every interest- whether itâ€™s sports, like martial arts or Lacrosse, or a STEAM camp that delves into some Crazy Contraptions or even the Flat Earth Theory. Summer camps are an important part of youth development as they are designed to keep kids learning, active and engaged throughout the summer break. Instead of summer learning loss, Boys & Girls Club summer camps create brain gain throughout the summer!
