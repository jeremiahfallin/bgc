Junior Club is for 1st grade youth and includes specialized programming that is age specific and focuses on activities that keep youngsters learning, engaged and having fun. Junior Club helps 1st graders develop confidence, learn new skills, make friends and is the program that prepares them for a smooth transition into regular Club programming when they reach 2nd grade. Junior Club has limited space as our goal is to ensure our member/staff ratio meets the special needs of our Junior Club members. Itâ€™s a Club within the Club!
